Each week constsits of two days of learning (workshops, presentations and research) and two days of project work in teams of 4 people, followed by a presentation of the project outcome and struggles.

##  Week 2 
### :school_satchel: Main workshop learnings: 
* npm 
* Callback functions (and callback hell! :scream:)
* Test-driven development
* No function, however small, should go untested

### :wavy_dash: Design challenge: Layout and spacing
* Try to create style guidelines (like [Airbnb](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)) for your project website that scales the size and spacing of elements based on mathematic ratios

### :rocket: Team project: Get to know callback functions, working with someone else code and learn to test everything
The project brief asked for: 
* A [to-do app](https://fac-14.github.io/teamcoolerweek-2/) 
* A [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fac-14/teamcoolerweek-2) ready for code review
